# DECIDE_WP1

DECIDE project is creating species distribution models at 100m resolution for the whole of the UK in order to inform citizen science data collection. This repository is just version control for the scripts associated with work package 1 on the DECIDE project. There are MANY more scripts associated with my work for this project but I'm only syncing the main scripts.
